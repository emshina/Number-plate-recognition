MUCHINA PAUL KAMAU AND MUCHINA MARY PLP PYTHON PROJECT

# Number-plate-recognition
This is a project where we can use computer visions to detect and recognize the number plate of a car and take the neccesary actions stated.


BACKGROUND/ PROBLEM STATEMENT

Traffic control and vehicle owner identification have become a major problem in every country.  Sometimes, it becomes difficult to identify vehicle owner who violates traffic rules and drives too fast.
Therefore, it is not possible to catch and punish those kinds of people because the traffic personnel might not be able to retrieve the vehicle number from the moving vehicle because of the speed of the vehicle. Therefore, there is a need to develop the system as one of the solutions to this problem. 
Our Detect and Recognize Vehicle License Plate will detect the license plate from an image and video. It can also detect in real-time using OpenCV and Python-tesseract. The user will just need to upload an image or video from their device.
Sometimes also we need an automatic gate opening where we do not need someone to keep sitting around the gate opening road blocks or gates for the vehicles to pass.
To solve this we need a real time using OpenCv which will detect the number plate of the vehicle and open the road blocks or gate automatically.


WORKING OF THE PROJECT 

This system will detect and recognize vehicle license plates from a user’s uploaded file. The system can also detect vehicle number plates in real-time, by just clicking on the device’s camera.
The system will detect and recognize the license plate and if it’s been detected, it will be displayed to the user. The front-end involves Html, CSS, and JavaScript and the back-end involves Python. The framework used is Django and the database is MySQL. 
We have implemented OpenCV and Python-tesseract libraries. Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google’s Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported.



ADVANTAGES

  -	It is easy to maintain.
  -	It is user-friendly.
  -	The system will automatically detect and recognize the license plate.
  -	It can detect vehicle license plates from an image and videos.
  -	It can also detect in real-time.
  
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The system comprises 1 major module with their sub-modules as follows:

	USER:
   •	Detection 
    o	Image 
    -	User has to upload an image for detection.
    o	Video 
    -	User has to upload a video for detection
    o	Real-time
    -	From the user’s device, with a click of the button camera will open to detect         the car license plate in real-time.
